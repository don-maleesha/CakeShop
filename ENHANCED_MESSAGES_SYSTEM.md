- **Fixed positioning**: Toasts appear in top-right corner with proper z-index

### 2. Enhanced Confirmation Dialogs

#### Product Deletion

- **After**: Detailed warning with:
  - Product name identification
  - Clear consequences explanation

### 3. Improved Success Messages

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
