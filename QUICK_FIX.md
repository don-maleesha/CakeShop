# Quick Fix Instructions

## The Issue
The profile page was failing because:
1. Missing `jsonwebtoken` package (for JWT token verification)
2. Missing `cookie-parser` package (for handling cookies)

## The Fix
I've already:
âœ… Added the missing dependencies to package.json
âœ… Updated the server code to use cookie-parser
âœ… Enhanced error handling in the profile component
âœ… Added fallback functionality

## Next Steps (You need to do this):

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in the API directory and run:
```bash
cd "C:\xampp\htdocs\CakeShop\api"
npm install
```

### 2. Start the API Server
In the same terminal:
```bash
node index.js
```

You should see output like:
```
Attempting to connect to MongoDB...
âœ… MongoDB Connected to cake-shop database
ðŸš€ Server is running on http://localhost:4000
```

### 3. Test the Profile Feature
- Keep the API server running
- Go to your React app (http://localhost:5173)
- Log in if not already logged in
- Click on your user avatar â†’ Profile
- The profile page should now load properly

## What Was Implemented:

### âœ… Complete User Profile System
- **Profile View**: Shows user info fetched from database
- **Profile Edit**: Update name, email, phone, address
- **User Stats**: Shows total orders, spending, custom orders
- **Recent Orders**: Displays last 5 orders with status
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes saved to database immediately

### âœ… Enhanced User Experience
- Loading states and error handling
- Success/error messages
- Fallback to cached data if server unavailable
- Responsive design
- Form validation

### âœ… Security & Performance
- JWT authentication for all profile operations
- Protected routes
- Input validation
- Cookie-based session management

The profile feature is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
